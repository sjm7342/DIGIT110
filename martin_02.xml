<newRecipe>Our recipe (halved from the original)

<l1><ing>1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened</ing>
<ing>1/2 lb. sugar</ing>
<ing>1/4 tsp. mace</ing>
<ing>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</ing>
<ing>2 eggs</ing>
<ing>3/4 lb. flour</ing></l1>

Using an electric mixer, <step key="1">cream together the <ing>butter </ing>and <ing>sugar</ing></step>. Then <step key="2">add the <ing>eggs</ing> and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled</step>. <step key="3">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined</step>. <step key="4">Scoop and roll the <ing>dough</ing> by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat</step>. [You could also <step key="5">refrigerate the <ing>dough</ing> until it’s firm enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds</step>.]

<step key="6">Bake  at 350F for 15-18 minutes</step> (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time) They’re done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about two dozen <result>cookies</result>.</newRecipe>

<outro>The Results

If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We added the <ing>cinnamon</ing> because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the <ing>mace</ing> nicely. These are mild, fairly soft <result>cookies</result> that are great with tea. We rolled and patted the <ing>dough</ing> into individual <result>cookies</result> because it was too soft and stick to roll out, but a little bit more <ing>flour</ing> and a stint in the <obj>fridge</obj> might make the <ing>dough</ing> easier to work with a <obj>rolling pin</obj>.</outro>
