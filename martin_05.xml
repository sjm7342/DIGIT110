    <title>BALLAD OF BOOKER T.</title> by
    <poet>Langston Hughes</poet></bgrd>
    <name>Booker T.</name></intro>
    <poem>Was a practical man.
        He said, Till the soil
        And learn from the land.
        Let down your bucket
        Where you are.
        Your fate is here
        And not afar.

        But <name>Booker T.</name>
        Was nobody's fool:
        You may carve a dream
        With an humble tool.
        The tallest tower
        Can tumble down
        If it be not rooted
        In solid ground.
        So, being a far-seeing

        Practical man,
        He said, Train your head, Your heart, and your hand. Your fate is here
        And not afar,
        So let down your bucket Where you are.</poem>
