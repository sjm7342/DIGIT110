<epigraph><text>Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her; If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!”

<chapter>Chapter 1</chapter>
<book>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
<quote>“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just re- member that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</quote>
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually commu- nicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal
more than that. In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments,
a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made
me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick
to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, un-
known men. Most of the confidences were unsought–frequently I
have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized
by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering
on the horizon–for the intimate revelations of young men or at least
the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and
marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of
infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget
that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</book>
