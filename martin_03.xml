<script><direction><char key="Bogart">Rick</char> now <action>SHOOTS</action> at <char key="Veidt">Strasser</char>, who crumples to the ground. 

At the sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police 
car <action>SPEEDS</action> in and comes to a stop near <char key="Rains">Renault</char>. Four 
<char>gendarmes</char> hurriedly jump out. 

In the distance the plane turns onto the runway. 

The <char>gendarmes</char> run to <char key="Rains">Renault</char>. The first one hurriedly 
salutes him.</direction> 

<char key="heading">GENDARME</char> 
<dialogue>Mon Capitaine!</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>Major Strasser's been shot.</dialogue> 

<direction><char key="Rains">Renault</char> pauses and looks at <char key="Bogart">Rick</char>. <char key="Bogart">Rick</char> returns <char key="Rains">Renault's </char>
gaze with expressionless eyes.</direction> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>Round up the usual suspects.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">GENDARME</char> 
<dialogue>Oui, mon Capitaine.</dialogue> 

<direction>The <char>gendarmes</char> take <char key="Veidt">Strasser's</char> body away and then drive off. 

<char key="Rains">Renault</char> walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy 
water, and opens it.</direction> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char>

<dialogue>Well, <char key="Bogart">Rick</char>, you're not only a 
sentimentalist, but you've become 
a patriot.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RICK</char> 
<dialogue>Maybe, but it seemed like a good time 
to start.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>I think perhaps you're right.</dialogue> 

<direction>As he pours the water into a glass, <char key="Rains">Renault</char> sees the Vichy 
label and quickly <action>DROPS</action> the bottle into a trash basket which 
he then <action>KICKS</action> over.

He walks over and stands beside <char key="Bogart">Rick</char>. They both watch the 
plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears 
into the clouds.

<char key="Bogart">Rick</char> and <char key="Rains">Louis</char> slowly walk away from the hangar toward the 
runway . </direction>

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>It might be a good idea for you 
to disappear from Casablanca for 
a while. There's a Free French 
garrison over at Brazzaville. 
I could be induced to arrange a 
passage .</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RICK</char> 
<dialogue>My letter of transit? I could use 
a trip. But it doesn't make any 
difference about our bet. You 
still owe me ten thousand francs.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>And that ten thousand francs should 
pay our expenses.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RICK</char> 
<dialogue>Our expenses?</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RENAULT</char> 
<dialogue>Uh huh.</dialogue> 

<char key="heading">RICK</char> 
<dialogue>Louis, I think this is the beginning 
of a beautiful friendship.</dialogue>

<direction>The two walk off together into the night.</direction> 

<fade>FADE OUT.</fade>
